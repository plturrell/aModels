# Experimental Package

This package contains experimental features and components that are still under development and are not yet considered part of the stable API.

## Purpose

The `exp` (experimental) package serves as a staging area for new ideas and features. It allows developers to work on and share new components without committing to their long-term support. This provides a way to innovate and iterate quickly on new capabilities for the framework.

## Warning

**The code in this package is subject to change without notice.**

APIs may be modified or removed, and there are no guarantees of stability or backward compatibility. Use the code here at your own risk, and do not rely on it for production applications.

## How to Use

If you are interested in trying out the latest features, you can import and use the components from this package. However, be prepared for breaking changes in future updates.

Once a feature has been proven to be useful and its API has stabilized, it will be moved from the `exp` package into a permanent location within the framework.
