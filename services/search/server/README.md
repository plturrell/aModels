# Search Server

This directory contains the core backend server for the Agentic Search & Discovery Platform.

## 1. Overview

The server is the central component of the platform. It exposes a RESTful API that the `client` application consumes, and it is responsible for orchestrating the entire search process. This includes receiving user queries, coordinating with the various backend modules (like `search-inference` and `qa`), and returning the final, aggregated results.

## 2. Core Responsibilities

- **API Gateway**: Provides the primary API endpoints for search, question-answering, and other platform features.
- **Query Processing**: Handles incoming search requests, including parsing, validation, and sanitization.
- **Orchestration**: Manages the flow of a search query across the different components. For a hybrid search, it would:
    1. Send the query to the traditional lexical search engine.
    2. Send the query to the `search-inference` service for semantic analysis and vector-based retrieval.
    3. Merge and re-rank the results from both search methods.
- **Integration**: Communicates with other services like the `embeddings` generator and the `qa` module.
- **Configuration Management**: Loads and manages the server's configuration, including connection details for other services and settings for the search algorithms.
- **Security & Authentication**: Manages user authentication and ensures that users can only access the data they are permitted to see.

## 3. How to Run

To run the server, you would typically use a command generated by the `build-tools`. The specific command would be found in the build scripts.

```bash
# Example command (actual command may vary)
./bin/search-server --config ./config/server.yml
```
