# Project Documentation

This directory is intended to hold detailed documentation for the VaultGemma LocalAI project.

While the `README.md` files in the various source code directories provide a good overview of the individual components, this directory is the place for more in-depth, long-form documentation that doesn't fit neatly into the codebase.

## Suggested Content

This directory could include:

*   **Architectural Diagrams**: Visual representations of the system architecture, request flow, and component interactions.
*   **API Reference**: A detailed, auto-generated, or manually written reference for the RESTful API, including all endpoints, request/response schemas, and example usage.
*   **Deployment Guides**: Step-by-step instructions for deploying the server in different environments (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, bare metal).
*   **Tutorials**: Guides for common tasks, such as adding a new agent domain, creating a custom model, or integrating the server with other applications.
*   **Design Documents**: The original design documents or RFCs that outline the rationale behind key architectural decisions.

By centralizing this documentation here, you can provide a comprehensive resource for developers, operators, and users of the system.
