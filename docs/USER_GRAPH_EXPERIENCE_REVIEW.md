# User Knowledge Graph & GNN Experience Review

## Executive Summary

**Current Rating: 6.2/10**

This review evaluates the user-facing experience for analyzing information, exploring the knowledge graph, and leveraging GNN capabilities from the user's perspective across Browser, Analytics, LocalAI, and Search services.

## Current State Analysis

### 1. Browser Service (User Interface)

**Current Capabilities:**
- ✅ Unified search includes "knowledge_graph" as a source
- ✅ Basic search results display
- ✅ Perplexity-style interface for search
- ✅ LocalAI chat integration
- ✅ Telemetry and analytics dashboards

**Gaps:**
- ❌ No interactive graph visualization
- ❌ No graph exploration UI
- ❌ No relationship browsing
- ❌ No GNN insights displayed to users
- ❌ No graph-based recommendations
- ❌ Limited understanding of graph structure
- ❌ No visual query builder for graph queries
- ❌ No graph analytics dashboard

**User Experience Issues:**
- Users can search but can't explore relationships
- No way to see "what's connected to this?"
- No visual representation of graph structure
- GNN capabilities exist but are invisible to users
- No guided exploration or discovery

### 2. Analytics Service

**Current Capabilities:**
- ✅ GNN integration (QueryGNNInsights, PredictWithGNN)
- ✅ Predictive analytics with GNN enhancement
- ✅ Anomaly detection using GNN
- ✅ Pattern detection

**Gaps:**
- ❌ No user-facing API endpoints
- ❌ No visualization of predictions
- ❌ No interactive analytics dashboard
- ❌ No way for users to trigger GNN analysis
- ❌ Results not exposed in user-friendly format
- ❌ No explanation of GNN insights

**User Experience Issues:**
- Backend has GNN but users can't access it
- No UI to request predictions
- No visualization of what GNN found
- No way to understand "why" the prediction

### 3. Search Service

**Current Capabilities:**
- ✅ Hybrid search (LLM + GNN embeddings)
- ✅ Graph structure extraction from queries
- ✅ GNN embedding support
- ✅ Semantic search with graph context

**Gaps:**
- ❌ GNN features not visible to users
- ❌ No explanation of why results are relevant
- ❌ No graph-based result clustering
- ❌ No relationship highlighting in results
- ❌ No "related entities" suggestions

**User Experience Issues:**
- Users get results but don't understand graph connections
- No way to see "related items"
- No visualization of search graph context
- GNN improvements are invisible

### 4. LocalAI Service

**Current Capabilities:**
- ✅ Multi-domain agent routing
- ✅ OpenAI-compatible API
- ✅ LLM inference

**Gaps:**
- ❌ No graph-aware prompts
- ❌ No graph context injection
- ❌ No graph-based reasoning
- ❌ No visualization of graph reasoning

**User Experience Issues:**
- LLM doesn't leverage graph structure
- No graph-enhanced responses
- No way to ask "show me the graph"

## Critical User Pain Points

1. **"I can search but can't explore"** - Users find items but can't see connections
2. **"I don't know what GNN found"** - GNN insights exist but are invisible
3. **"I can't visualize relationships"** - No graph visualization tools
4. **"I don't understand why results are relevant"** - No explanation of graph connections
5. **"I can't ask graph questions"** - No natural language graph queries
6. **"I can't see patterns"** - No visual pattern discovery
7. **"I can't get recommendations"** - No graph-based suggestions

## Success Criteria for 9.8/10

1. ✅ Interactive graph visualization with zoom, pan, filter
2. ✅ Natural language graph queries ("show me all tables connected to customer")
3. ✅ GNN insights visible and explained to users
4. ✅ Relationship explorer with path finding
5. ✅ Graph analytics dashboard with metrics
6. ✅ AI-assisted graph exploration (LocalAI + Graph)
