// Go Workspace Configuration for aModels Mono-Repository
// 
// This file enables multi-module development across the entire mono-repo.
// 
// Usage:
//   1. Copy this file to go.work: cp go.work.example go.work
//   2. The go.work file is gitignored (developer-specific)
//   3. IDEs will use this for cross-module navigation and autocomplete
//   4. All `go` commands will resolve local modules automatically
//
// Benefits:
//   - Single source of truth for all module versions
//   - IDE autocomplete works across services
//   - No need for replace directives in go.mod files
//   - Simplified dependency management
//
// Documentation: https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/workspaces

// Notes:
// - Only include directories that have a go.mod file
// - Paths are relative to this file's location (/home/aModels)
// - The workspace unifies all module versions across services
// - Use `go work sync` to synchronize go.sum files
